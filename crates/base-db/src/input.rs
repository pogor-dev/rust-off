//! This module specifies the input to rust-analyzer. In some sense, this is
//! **the** most important module, because all other fancy stuff is strictly
//! derived from this input.
//!
//! Note that neither this module, nor any other part of the analyzer's core do
//! actual IO. See `vfs` and `project_model` in the `rust-analyzer` crate for how
//! actual IO is done and lowered to input.

/// Source roots *might* be nested: in this case, a file belongs to

/// source root, and the analyzer does not know the root path of the source root at
/// all. So, a file from one source root can't refer to a file in another source
/// root by path.
