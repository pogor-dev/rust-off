//! This module implements import-resolution/macro expansion algorithm.
//!
//! The result of this module is `DefMap`: a data structure which contains:
//!
//!   * a tree of modules for the crate
//!   * for each module, a set of items visible in the module (directly declared
//!     or imported)
//!
//! Note that `DefMap` contains fully macro expanded code.
//!
//! Computing `DefMap` can be partitioned into several logically
//! independent "phases". The phases are mutually recursive though, there's no
//! strict ordering.
//!
//! ## Collecting RawItems
//!
//! This happens in the `raw` module, which parses a single source file into a
//! set of top-level items. Nested imports are desugared to flat imports in this
//! phase. Macro calls are represented as a triple of `(Path, Option<Name>,
//! TokenTree)`.
//!
//! ## Collecting Modules
//!
//! This happens in the `collector` module. In this phase, we recursively walk
//! tree of modules, collect raw items from submodules, populate module scopes
//! with defined items (so, we assign item ids in this phase) and record the set
//! of unresolved imports and macros.
//!
//! While we walk tree of modules, we also record macro_rules definitions and
//! expand calls to macro_rules defined macros.
//!
//! ## Resolving Imports
//!
//! We maintain a list of currently unresolved imports. On every iteration, we
//! try to resolve some imports from this list. If the import is resolved, we
//! record it, by adding an item to current module scope and, if necessary, by
//! recursively populating glob imports.
//!
//! ## Resolving Macros
//!
//! macro_rules from the same crate use a global mutable namespace. We expand
//! them immediately, when we collect modules.
//!
//! Macros from other crates (including proc-macros) can be used with
//! `foo::bar!` syntax. We handle them similarly to imports. There's a list of
//! unexpanded macros. On every iteration, we try to resolve each macro call
//! path and, upon success, we run macro expansion and "collect module" phase on
//! the result.

/// Every crate has a primary `DefMap` whose root is the crate's main file (`main.rs`/`lib.rs`),
/// computed by the `crate_def_map` query. Additionally, every block expression introduces the
/// opportunity to write arbitrary item and module hierarchies, and thus gets its own `DefMap` that
/// is computed by the `block_def_map` query.
