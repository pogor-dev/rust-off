//! This module describes hir-level representation of expressions.
//!
//! This representation is:
//!
//! 1. Identity-based. Each expression has an `id`, so we can distinguish
//!    between different `1` in `1 + 1`.
//! 2. Independent of syntax. Though syntactic provenance information can be
//!    attached separately via id-based side map.
//! 3. Unresolved. Paths are stored as sequences of names, and not as defs the
//!    names refer to.
//! 4. Desugared. There's no `if let`.
//!
//! See also a neighboring `body` module.
