//! A simplified AST that only contains items.
//!
//! This is the primary IR used throughout `hir_def`. It is the input to the name resolution
//! algorithm, as well as to the queries defined in `adt.rs`, `data.rs`, and most things in
//! `attr.rs`.
//!
//! `ItemTree`s are built per `HirFileId`, from the syntax tree of the parsed file. This means that
//! they are crate-independent: they don't know which `#[cfg]`s are active or which module they
//! belong to, since those concepts don't exist at this level (a single `ItemTree` might be part of
//! multiple crates, or might be included into the same crate twice via `#[path]`).
//!
//! One important purpose of this layer is to provide an "invalidation barrier" for incremental
//! computations: when typing inside an item body, the `ItemTree` of the modified file is typically
//! unaffected, so we don't have to recompute name resolution results or item data (see `data.rs`).
//!
//! The `ItemTree` for the currently open file can be displayed by using the VS Code command
//! "rust-analyzer: Debug ItemTree".
//!
//! Compared to rustc's architecture, `ItemTree` has properties from both rustc's AST and HIR: many
//! syntax-level Rust features are already desugared to simpler forms in the `ItemTree`, but name
//! resolution has not yet been performed. `ItemTree`s are per-file, while rustc's AST and HIR are
//! per-crate, because we are interested in incrementally computing it.
//!
//! The representation of items in the `ItemTree` should generally mirror the surface syntax: it is
//! usually a bad idea to desugar a syntax-level construct to something that is structurally
//! different here. Name resolution needs to be able to process attributes and expand macros
//! (including attribute macros), and having a 1-to-1 mapping between syntax and the `ItemTree`
//! avoids introducing subtle bugs.
//!
//! In general, any item in the `ItemTree` stores its `AstId`, which allows mapping it back to its
//! surface syntax.
