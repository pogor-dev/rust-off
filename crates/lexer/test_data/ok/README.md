# Compacted PDF Syntax integration tests

With support from the DARPA-funded SafeDocs program, the PDF Association CTO, Peter Wyatt, has created a detailed test matrix of all possible combinations of PDF token pairings and an associated test PDF file. The test PDF file tests parsing valid combinations of adjacent PDF tokens both in the body of a PDF as well as in PDF content streams and is available in the [PDF Association GitHub repository](https://github.com/pdf-association/safedocs/tree/main/CompactedSyntax).

This material is based upon work supported by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) under Contract No. HR001119C0079. Any opinions, findings and conclusions or recommendations expressed in this material are those of the author(s) and do not necessarily reflect the views of the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA). Approved for public release.

This PDF file is used for integration tests to assess the correctness of the lexical analysis.
